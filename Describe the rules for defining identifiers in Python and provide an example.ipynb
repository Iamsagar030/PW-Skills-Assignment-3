    "Identifiers are names given to various elements in a program, such as variables, functions, classes, modules, etc.\n",
    "Followings are the rules for defining identifiers in Python:\n",
    "1. Valid Characters: Alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and the underscore (_) character can be used as identifiers. They can't begin with a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Case Sensitivity: MyVariable, myvariable, and MYVARIABLE are all distinct identifiers since Python is case-sensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reserved Keywords: As identifiers have unique meanings in the language, they cannot be reserved words or Python keywords. There will be a syntax error if you try to use a keyword as an identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Length Limitation: Identifiers can be of any length, but it's recommended to keep them concise and descriptive for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Naming Conventions: Python adheres to the snake_case standard, which calls for using underscores to separate words in multi-word identifiers and lowercase letters for variable names. Take my_variable, total_sum, etc. as examples. Nonetheless, CamelCase is the standard for class names; each word begins with an uppercase letter (PascalCase)."
